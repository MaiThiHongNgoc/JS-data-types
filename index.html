<!--<h2>JavaScript</h2>

<p>When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let x = 16 + "Volvo";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>  -->



<!--<h2>JavaScript Strings</h2>

<p>You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let answer1 = "It's alright";
let answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
let answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
answer1 + "<br>" + 
answer2 + "<br>" + 
answer3;
</script>  -->

<h2>JavaScript Numbers</h2>

<p>Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
let x1 = 34.00;
let x2 = 34;
let x3 = 3.14;

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
x1 + "<br>" + x2 + "<br>" + x3;
</script>
